# Portfolio

**Â¡Hi! This is my portfolio.**  

You can see it [here](https://juanpaboterodev.netlify.app/).

It contains a list of projects I've worked on, and a list of technologies I've used.  
You can find the project's source code on the [screens folder](https://github.com/boterobpablo/portfolio/tree/main/src/app/screens) 
on this repository.

It's built with **Angular** as Framework.  

It uses [apvarun.github.io/toastify-js](https://apvarun.github.io/toastify-js/#) as toast notifications library.

Hope you like it!
